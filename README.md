Data analysis transforms raw information into actionable intelligence, crucial for strategic decision-making.
This process involves collecting, organizing, interpreting, and visualizing data to reveal patterns, trends, and correlations. Effective data analysis boosts accuracy, efficiency, and innovation, enabling organizations to optimize performance and minimize risks. 

This project leverages Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze Netflix data. 
Pandas was used for data cleaning and type conversion, 
while NumPy facilitated advanced calculations and statistical analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn generated compelling visualizations to illuminate data distribution and relationships. 
The primary objective is to derive valuable insights from the Netflix dataset, leading to strategic recommendations.
